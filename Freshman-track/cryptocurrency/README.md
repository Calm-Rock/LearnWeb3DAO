#### NOTE: Whenever implementing a smart contract which needs to comply with a standard, try to find an OZ reference implementation rather than rewriting the entire standard from scratch.

Created my own cryptocurrency using the Open Zepplin ERC-20 contract. It's called Cheeto Coin.

You can find the contract [here](https://rinkeby.etherscan.io/address/0xF08b0444373c0954EE198e40c377647fD7C846bd) on Rinkbey Testnet.
